# ni.py-bridge

Very much a work in progress, check back later.

**Warning: This tool does not verify cryptographic signatures (yet) and is for running locally only. DO NOT place it on a publically accessible server!**

A Nostr to AT/Bluesky &amp; Activity Pub (coming soon) local bridge. This is a work in progress, but can be run on a PC or Android device and then added as a relay to a Nostr client.

To Do (First)
* Add Activity Pub support via Mastodon API
* Write a better readme

To Do (Later)
* Seperate out post lengths for AT & Activity Pub
* Verify cryptographic signatures so it can be remotely hosted


To Do (potentially)
* Get replies (or notifications of replies) from other networks on Nostr
